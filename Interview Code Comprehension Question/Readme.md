#### What's the output?

```javascript
async function foo() {
  return 'Hello'
}
const result = foo();
console.log(result);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 

The output of this code will be:

```
Promise { 'Hello' }
```

Explanation:
- Since `foo` is declared as an async function, it always returns a promise.
- Even though `foo` immediately returns the string `'Hello'`, it wraps that string in a resolved promise.
- Therefore, when you log `result`, it's a promise object with the resolved value `'Hello'`.

#### Above Question Convert the output as a String and explain

```javascript
async function foo() {
  return 'Hello'
}
const result = foo();
console.log(result);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 

To modify the code so that `result` is a string instead of a promise, you can use `await` to wait for the promise returned by `foo` to resolve. Here's the modified code:

```javascript
async function foo() {
  return 'Hello'; // Return the string 'Hello' immediately
}

async function main() {
  const result = await foo(); // Wait for the promise returned by foo to resolve
  console.log(result); // Print the value of result to the console
}

main();
```

This code defines an `async` function `main` which calls `foo` using `await`. By awaiting the promise returned by `foo`, we ensure that `result` contains the resolved value of the promise, which is the string `'Hello'`.

When you run this code, it will print:

```
Hello
```

</p>

#### What's the output

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout')
},0)
Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log('Promise'))
console.log('End');
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 

Let's break down the code line by line:

1. `setTimeout(() => { console.log('Timeout') }, 0)`: This line schedules a task to be executed asynchronously after a delay of 0 milliseconds using `setTimeout`. Even though the delay is specified as 0 milliseconds, the callback function will not execute immediately. Instead, it will be placed in the event loop to be executed in the next tick of the event loop. So, the message 'Timeout' will be logged to the console after any synchronous code has finished executing.

2. `Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'))`: This line creates a resolved promise using `Promise.resolve()` and attaches a callback function using `.then()`. The callback function will be executed asynchronously in the next tick of the event loop. So, the message 'Promise' will be logged to the console after any synchronous code has finished executing, but before the message from the `setTimeout` callback.

3. `console.log('End')`: This line logs the message 'End' to the console synchronously. It will be executed immediately after the previous line, without waiting for any asynchronous tasks to complete.

In summary, the code schedules two asynchronous tasks (one using `setTimeout` and the other using a resolved promise) to be executed in the next tick of the event loop. The message 'End' is logged synchronously. Therefore, the output in the console will likely be:

```
End
Promise
Timeout
```

The order may vary slightly depending on the JavaScript engine and the environment in which the code is executed.

#### What will be printed in the console as output?

```javascript
[1,2] == [1,2]
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 

The expression `[1,2] == [1,2]` will evaluate to `false` because it compares two separate arrays, even if they have identical contents. In JavaScript, arrays are objects, and the equality operator (`==`) checks if the two operands reference the same object, which is not the case here.

#### What's the output

```javascript
const user1 = {
  name: 'Jhon',
  age: 25,
  address: {
    city: 'Mumbai',
    state: 'Maharashtra'
  },
}

const user2 = user1;

user2.name = 'Ramesh'
user2.address.city = 'Pune'

console.log(user1);
console.log(user2);
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: 

The output of the code will be:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Ramesh',
  age: 25,
  address: {
    city: 'Pune',
    state: 'Maharashtra'
  }
}
{
  name: 'Ramesh',
  age: 25,
  address: {
    city: 'Pune',
    state: 'Maharashtra'
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. `user1` is an object with properties `name`, `age`, and `address`.
2. `user2` is assigned the reference of `user1`. This means both `user1` and `user2` point to the same memory location.
3. When `user2.name` is changed to `'Ramesh'`, it also changes `user1.name` because they are referencing the same object.
4. Similarly, when `user2.address.city` is changed to `'Pune'`, it also changes `user1.address.city` for the same reason.
5. Hence, both `user1` and `user2` end up with the same values for `name` and `address` properties.
