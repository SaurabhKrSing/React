###  Why we use React

  React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces in web development. Here are some key points highlighting its significance:

  1. **Declarative**: React allows developers to describe the UI based on its current state, making it easier to understand and maintain code.
  2. **Component-Based**: UIs are broken down into reusable components, promoting code reusability and modularization.
  3. **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, improving performance by minimizing actual DOM manipulations.
  4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, simplifying state management and making applications more predictable.
  5. **Ecosystem**: React has a vast ecosystem with numerous libraries and tools for enhanced development, testing, and debugging.
  6. **Support**: Backed by Facebook and a large community, React receives regular updates and has extensive documentation and resources.
  7. **Cross-Platform**: React can be used to build not only web applications but also mobile apps using React Native, enabling code sharing between platforms.
  8. **Performance**: React's efficient rendering process and optimization techniques result in fast and responsive user interfaces.
  9. **Accessibility**: React provides features and tools to create accessible UIs, ensuring inclusivity for all users.
  10. **Flexibility**: React can be easily integrated with other libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to leverage existing tools and technologies.

### What is Components

  A reusable piece of code used to construct elements on a page. Components enable the breakdown of complex UIs, enhancing maintenance and scalability. They can receive props and manage their own state, facilitating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### What is States

  State represents the data managed internally by a component, including form input, fetched data, and UI-related information like the visibility of a modal. Global state refers to data relevant to the entire app rather than a single component.

### Difference between components and states

  | Feature         | Component                                                    | State                                                                   |
  | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Definition      | A reusable UI element in React                               | Represents the current state of the component                           |
  | Purpose         | Represents the UI structure                                  | Manages the data and its changes                                        |
  | Type            | Can be functional or class-based                             | Internal object in class components                                     |
  | Initialization  | Can receive props from parent components                     | Initialized within the component constructor or useState hook           |
  | Update          | Can be updated by parent component or through internal logic | Updated through setState method or useState hook                        |
  | Scope           | Can have local or global scope                               | Limited to the component where it's defined                             |
  | Access          | Can access props passed from parent component                | Accessed and modified within the component itself                       |
  | Lifecycle Hooks | Can use lifecycle methods in class components                | Does not have lifecycle methods, but can be updated with useEffect hook |
  | Mutable         | Can be mutable or immutable                                  | Mutable; can be updated using setState                                  |
  | Examples        | Button, Card, Header                                         | Count, Text, Toggle                                                     |

### What is Hooks

  Allows us to use state and other React features within functional components.


  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### Types of Hooks

  Sure, here are definitions and code examples for seven commonly used React hooks:

  1. **useState**: useState hook manages component state by allowing functional components to hold and update state variables. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    function Counter() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Count: {count}</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  2. **useEffect**: useEffect handles side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation, after component renders. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
    function Example() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      useEffect(() => {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
      }, [count]);
      return (
        <div>
          <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
            Click me
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  3. **useContext**: useContext provides access to React context within functional components, allowing them to consume context values. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useContext } from 'react';
    import MyContext from './MyContext';
    function MyComponent() {
      const value = useContext(MyContext);
      return <div>{value}</div>;
    }
    ```

  4. **useReducer**: useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. 

  ```jsx
  import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
  const initialState = { count: 0 };
  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
      default:
        throw new Error();
    }
  }
  function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  5. **useCallback**: useCallback memoizes callback functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
    function CounterButton({ onClick }) {
      return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
    }
    function ParentComponent() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      const increment = useCallback(() => setCount(count + 1), [count]);
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Count: {count}</p>
          <CounterButton onClick={increment} />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  6. **useMemo**: useMemo memoizes expensive computations, optimizing performance by caching computed values. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';
    function ExpensiveCalculation({ count }) {
      // This expensive calculation will only run when `count` changes
      const result = useMemo(() => {
        console.log('Running expensive calculation');
        return count * 2;
      }, [count]);
      return <p>Result: {result}</p>;
    }
    function ParentComponent() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
          <ExpensiveCalculation count={count} />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

  7. **useRef**: useRef creates a mutable reference object that persists across component re-renders. 

    ```jsx
    import React, { useRef } from 'react';
    function FocusInput() {
      const inputRef = useRef(null);
      const handleClick = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      };
      return (
        <div>
          <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
          <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus Input</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
